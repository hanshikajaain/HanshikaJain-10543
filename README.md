# Pattern Logic Tool in C

## Overview
This project prints a triangular pattern of numbers based on user input using nested loops in C.

## What I Learned
- How nested loops control rows and columns
- How to take input and format output in C
- How to compile and run C programs in VS Code
- How to use Git and GitHub for version control

## How to Run
1. Compile: `gcc project.c -o project`
2. Run: `./project`
3. Enter number of rows to see the pattern
## Files Included
- `project.c` — main C program
- `README.md` — project summary and learning reflection
## 🔢 Sample Output

Here’s the screenshot of the program running with input = 5:
